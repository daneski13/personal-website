`rust-finprim` is a minimal Rust library providing various primitive functions to perform financial calculations. Designed to be used as a dependency in other Rust projects, it offers a simple and efficient way to perform common financial operations, many of which are modeled after functions found in spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets.

## Features

- **Time Value of Money**: Present value, future value, payment calculations.
- **Interest Rate Calculations**: Nominal and effective interest rates, IRR, TWR, and MIRR.
- **Amortization, Depreciation, and Tax Functions**: Amortization schedules, depreciation methods (straight-line, declining balance, etc.), and tax calculations.
- **Derivative and Utility Functions**: Provides derivative of common financial functions and utility functions for implementing complex financial calculations.
